      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Repository and Environment' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Repository initialization and structure, 2) Environment and dependency setup, and 3) Configuration management implementation. For each subtask, provide a clear title, detailed description, and specific acceptance criteria.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup activities with a clear structure already defined. The complexity is moderate (4/10) because while it involves multiple technologies (Git, Python, Flask/FastAPI, SQLAlchemy), these are common setup procedures. The task is well-defined with specific steps and doesn't require complex decision-making or integration work."

For each subtask, include specific API endpoints to be used, data transformation requirements, and error recovery strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (7/10) as it involves working with LinkedIn's API to fetch and transform complex profile data. It requires creating a robust client that handles authentication, multiple API calls, data transformation, and database synchronization. Error handling, rate limiting compliance, and scheduled updates add to the complexity."

For each subtask, specify the endpoint routes, request/response formats, and validation requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (8/10) because it involves implementing multiple API endpoints that integrate all the previous components. It requires authentication middleware, request validation, error handling, and pagination. The endpoints must handle complex data relationships and ensure proper security. The task also depends on multiple previous tasks being completed."

For each subtask, include UI/UX requirements, data visualization needs, and user interaction patterns.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate-high complexity (6/10) as it involves creating a functional frontend application that interacts with the backend API. It requires implementing authentication flows, displaying complex profile data, and creating interactive interfaces for lead management. While Streamlit simplifies some aspects of UI development, integrating with the backend and handling state adds complexity."

For each subtask, include specific technical approaches, error handling strategies, and data validation requirements.",
      "reasoning": "This task has very high complexity (9/10) as it involves developing a system to discover and extract data from LinkedIn, which presents significant technical and compliance challenges. It requires evaluating different approaches (SerpApi, Selenium), implementing robust error handling, managing rate limiting, and creating a reliable data pipeline. The task also involves complex scheduling and data transformation logic."

For each subtask, include specific API documentation references, data mapping requirements, and synchronization strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (7/10) because it involves integrating with two different job board APIs (Lever and Greenhouse) that have different structures and authentication methods. It requires mapping company names to platform-specific identifiers, filtering for relevant job postings, and implementing a synchronization service. The task also involves scheduled updates and handling API limitations."
