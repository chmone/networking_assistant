      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Setup Project Repository and Environment' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Repository initialization with proper structure, 2) Environment setup with dependencies, and 3) Documentation and configuration files. For each subtask, provide detailed steps, acceptance criteria, and estimated time.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project setup procedures with clearly defined steps. While not technically complex, it requires careful organization to ensure the project foundation is solid. The task already has a good breakdown in the details, but can be organized into logical groupings for better tracking."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Configuration Manager' task into 3 subtasks: 1) Basic configuration loading from environment variables and files, 2) Configuration schema definition and validation, and 3) Singleton implementation with application-wide access. For each subtask, provide detailed implementation steps and test cases.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing a configuration system that will be used throughout the application. It has moderate complexity due to the need for validation, singleton pattern implementation, and handling multiple configuration sources. The example code provides a good starting point but needs to be expanded with validation and error handling."
