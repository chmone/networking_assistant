**Project:** `networking_assistant`
**Session Goal (Previous):** Re-initialize project, fix tests, resolve warnings, and prepare for next steps.
**Session Goal (This Session):** Conduct a full review of the codebase against the PRD to understand current implementation, logical flow, and identify gaps for achieving the PRD\'s vision.

**Work Completed (Previous Session - Summarized):**
*   Project re-initialized, dependencies installed, all (416) tests passing.
*   Key deprecation warnings (FastAPI `on_event`, SQLAlchemy `utcnow`) resolved.
*   `current_state.txt` initialized.
*   Git commit/push issues related to local terminal environment and GitHub secret scanning were discussed and resolved by the user manually.

**Full Code Review & PRD Alignment (This Session):**

**1. Overall Architecture & UI Intent:**
    *   The project uses FastAPI to create a backend API (`src/web_app/api_main.py`).
    *   Routers are in place for CRUD operations on Leads, Companies, and Job Postings (`src/web_app/routers/`).
    *   CORS is configured, indicating a web UI is expected.
    *   **PRD Alignment:** A UI is a core requirement.
    *   **Finding:** No UI code appears to be present in the current project structure. UI development is likely a future task.

**2. Core Lead Generation Workflow (PRD vs. Implementation):**

    *   **PRD Envisioned User-Driven Workflow:**
        1.  User inputs their LinkedIn profile URL and networking goals (target companies/roles).
        2.  System scrapes the user's profile (education, experience, skills).
        3.  System performs targeted LinkedIn searches for alumni from the user's school at target companies OR in target roles.
        4.  System scrapes potential lead profiles (deeper details).
        5.  Leads are ranked (strength of connection, relevance).
        6.  LLM is used to summarize lead profiles, identify networking angles, and suggest outreach messages.

    *   **Current Implemented Workflow (`Orchestrator.run_linkedin_workflow`):**
        *   **Input:** Uses pre-configured/default keywords (e.g., "Product Manager") and locations (e.g., "New York, NY") from `config_manager` OR accepts a list of such generic search queries. **Does not take user's LinkedIn profile URL or dynamically use user-specific alumni/target info.**
        *   **Lead Discovery (`LinkedInScraper`):**
            *   Uses SerpApi (Google Search API) to search `site:linkedin.com/in/` based on the generic keywords/locations.
            *   It *can* scrape by school (`scrape_alumni_by_school`), but this is not currently integrated into the main `run_linkedin_workflow` in a user-driven way.
            *   **Finding:** Relies on SERP data, not deep scraping of individual lead profiles (aligns with PRD V1 approach).
        *   **Enrichment (`LeadProcessor` & `CompanyScraper`):**
            *   Attempts to find company LinkedIn URLs (via `CompanyScraper` using SerpApi) for companies parsed from lead search results.
            *   Extracts basic company details.
        *   **Filtering & Ranking (`LeadProcessor`):**
            *   Filters leads based on location, role keywords, and a preference for mid-level (non-senior) roles (all from config).
            *   Scores leads based on these matches and if company data was found.
        *   **Storage:** Saves processed leads to the database.
        *   **LLM Integration:** **No LLM integration found** in the current data acquisition, processing, or orchestration flow.

**3. Detailed Component Analysis:**
    *   **`src/web_app/api_main.py`:** FastAPI app setup, includes routers.
    *   **`src/web_app/routers/leads.py`:** Standard CRUD endpoints for `Lead` objects. **No endpoint currently exists to trigger the automated, user-driven lead generation workflow.**
    *   **`src/data_acquisition/linkedin_scraper.py`:**
        *   Uses SerpApi to search Google for LinkedIn profiles.
        *   Methods: `scrape_alumni_by_school`, `scrape_pms_by_location`.
        *   Parses search results; does not perform deep scraping of individual LinkedIn profiles.
    *   **`src/data_acquisition/company_scraper.py`:** Uses SerpApi to find company LinkedIn URLs and basic company info.
    *   **`src/core/orchestrator.py`:**
        *   `run_linkedin_workflow` method orchestrates the current lead generation.
        *   Initiates `LinkedInScraper`, `CompanyScraper`, `LeadProcessor`.
        *   Currently calls `linkedin_scraper.scrape_pms_by_location` based on general config, not dynamically from user profile data.
    *   **`src/data_processing/lead_processor.py`:**
        *   Cleans, enriches (with company data), filters (location, keywords, seniority), and scores leads.
        *   Ranking logic is present here.
    *   **`src/data_processing/data_cleaner.py`:** (Existence noted, not deeply reviewed but assumed to handle data normalization).

**4. Key Gaps Compared to Full PRD Vision:**

    *   **User-Driven Workflow Initiation:**
        *   No API endpoint to accept user's LinkedIn URL and specific networking goals.
        *   `Orchestrator` doesn't currently process a specific user's profile to drive searches.
    *   **User Profile Scraping:** Logic to scrape a *given user's own LinkedIn profile* to extract their school, experience, etc., is missing.
    *   **Targeted Alumni Search Integration:** While `LinkedInScraper` *can* search by school, this isn't dynamically used in `Orchestrator` based on a scraped user profile. The connection between "user's alma mater" and "alumni search" is not automated.
    *   **Deep Lead Profile Scraping:** Current system uses SERP data (V1 PRD approach). Full profile data extraction (skills, detailed experience) is not implemented.
    *   **LLM Integration for Qualitative Analysis:** Completely missing. No LLM calls for profile summarization, identifying networking angles, or generating outreach messages.
    *   **UI Development:** No UI code found in the project.

**Current Overall Status & Next Steps for Next Agent/Session:**

*   **Codebase Health:** All tests pass, some major warnings addressed. The backend API structure is in place. Core components for data acquisition (via SerpApi), rule-based processing, and database interaction exist.
*   **Taskmaster:** `tasks/tasks.json` is likely missing (as it's not version controlled). Taskmaster commands requiring this file will fail. The first step for the next session should be to restore/regenerate this (Option A: obtain from original machine; Option B: re-parse `scripts/prd.txt` knowing this resets task states).
*   **Primary Focus for PRD Alignment:**
    1.  **Implement User Input & Profile Analysis:**
        *   Create an API endpoint (e.g., in `leads.py` or a new `generation_router.py`) to accept a user's LinkedIn URL and networking goals (target companies, roles).
        *   Develop functionality (likely in `LinkedInScraper` or a new module) to scrape the provided user's LinkedIn profile to extract their alma mater(s), experience, and skills.
    2.  **Integrate User Data into Search Strategy:**
        *   Modify `Orchestrator.run_linkedin_workflow` (or create a new workflow method) to use the scraped user data.
        *   Dynamically call `linkedin_scraper.scrape_alumni_by_school` using the user's alma mater(s).
        *   Refine search queries to use the user's target companies and roles in conjunction with alumni or keyword searches.
    3.  **Implement LLM Features:**
        *   Choose an LLM provider/library (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face Transformers/Langchain).
        *   Create a new service/module (e.g., `src/llm_services/analysis_service.py`).
        *   Integrate LLM calls into the `LeadProcessor` or `Orchestrator` after leads are found/filtered to:
            *   Summarize lead profiles.
            *   Identify key networking angles based on comparing user's profile to lead's profile.
            *   Draft outreach message suggestions.
    4.  **UI Development:** Begin planning and developing the user interface that will interact with these new backend endpoints.
    5.  **Consider Deep Lead Scraping (Post V1):** Evaluate adding functionality to scrape individual lead LinkedIn profiles more deeply if SERP data proves insufficient (PRD V2+ feature).

*   **Commit Changes:** The changes made in the previous session (test fixes, warning fixes, `requirements.txt`, `current_state.txt` updates) have been pushed manually by the user. Any further changes in *this* review session (i.e., this `current_state.txt` update) will need to be committed.
